                <h3>Struggling to get in the Zone?</h3>
                <h4>Here are Some Tips:</h4>
                <h4 class="mindset-numbers">1. Why do you want this?</h4>
                <p class="page-content">When beginning your weight lifting journey it is crucial to understand what your motive behind starting is. Are you going to lose weight, become more conditioned, build confidence, therapy, as a healthy habit? Without purpose and vision it becomes infinitely more difficult to stay consistent, and consistency is going to be a key factor to a new comers long term success and progression. One key tip I have is to start by setting one long term goal, and then set a short term goal to attain soon.</p>
                <h5>Why you may ask?</h5>
                <p class="page-content">We are impatient! We want to see results immediately, we want to become the best version of us as fast as possible. We are impatient from nature, and if we do not set goals that give us some immediate gratifitcation then we will give up. Thats why in the military they require you, first thing in the day to make your bed as it gives you your first accomplishment of the day and primes you to get into the mindset of achieving your goals. Without vision there will be no sense of direction, and with working out it is the same story. Goals are not attained overnight in the gym, and simply attending the gym will not be enough either. There has to be a clear sense of direction and focus when going ingo the gym as the quality of your lifts will be crucial to seeing progression.</p>
                <h5>Moral of the story is...</h5>
                <p class="page-content">Find your motive, find what you want to do and write it down so you see it. Make your goals attainable, and supplement your long term goals with short term goals that will get you to where you want to be!</p>

                    <h5>Progressive Overload</h5>
                    <p class="page-content workout-columns">
                        I can confidently say that progressive overload is going to be the most crucial aspect of being able to lift heavier over the long term. You want to continuously lift heavier as you gain stregnth. Our bodies are adaptable, we conform to the conditions that are around us. As time goes on and we continue to lift the same weight we get used to it, and your body adapts so we can handle those conditions. Its just like someone who lives in the cold for their whole life as opposed to someone that lives in the desest, they adapt to their conditions. Working out is a repeating process of putting microtears in your muscles. As you continue to feed yourself and go back to the gym those scars heal and build. However if we continue to do the same weight and reps, we will get into a phase of maintenance. If you want to see progess in yourself, there needs to be progress in your lifts, either in the repitions or weights.

                    <h5>Quality > Quantity</h5>
                    <p class="page-content workout-columns">
                        Ego lifting, ever heard of it? If not, let me refresh you. Ego lifting is where we lift weights that we are not capable of completing qulaity reps of. This is a bigger issue that a lot of people may think, as we are pressured by our surroundings and peers to lift heavy weights as a way of displaying superiority. However, it is key to learn to block out the noise and stay focused to complete quality reps. If you continuously are lifing weights that are too heavy you become at high risk of injury. Additionally, without understanding the motions and not completing them correctly we tend to not target the correct muscle groups, which in turn becomes a waste of time and negative to reach our goals. Learn to focus on completing quality reps with weight you are comfortable completing that excercise with. Keep focused and stick to quality over quantity.

                    <h5>Take a rest day!</h5>
                    <p class="page-content workout-columns">
                        Rest days, you start loving and learn to hate them as time goes on. Why take a rest day when you've had the best week of lifts ever? That sounds redundant, and who doesn't love an amazing pump? Well, if you care about building up your body then a rest day is crucial. Rest days allow us to give our body a break, to let those tears in our muscle fibers heal and to allow ourselves to focus on our diet. Make sure we meal prep for the week and get in the necessary micro-nutrients to see those healthy gains. Without a rest day our body enters a cycle of constant tearing and no healing, and like we discussed earlier, the healing is where the real magic happens and we see the progress. Look at working out as a way to prepare your muscles to feed and get bigger.

                    <h4 class="diet-header">Eat for your goals</h4>
                    <p class="page-content">It is important that the food you are eating is complimenting what your goals are. Lets use an example:
                        <br>Ones who are trying to put on muslce mass would have an surplus of protein in their diet. However someone who is trying to lose weight may look at cutting their carbs in their diet and increasing protein so they can thin up. On the other end, ones who are looking to bulk up may look at having a surplus of both carbs and protein. Be ready to base your gym and body goals around your diet, as that will be key for your success.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <h4 class="diet-header">Focus on the protein</h4>
                    <p class="page-content">I am going to speak on my personal experience with lifting. I started lifting at 155 pounds back in 2018. I had no idea what I was doing, all I knew is that I wanted to put on weight because I was contantly getting pick on for being skinny. The two main nutrients that got me to put on another 20 pounds were protein and carbs. Consuming sufficient protein will supply your muscles with the nurtients needed to grow, while carbs will give you the mass and energy needed to perform well in workouts.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <h4 class="diet-header">Dont complicate it!</h4>
                    <p class="page-content">A workout routine without a diet is a lifestyle bound to fail. Lets use another example:
                        <br>Say your good buddy Saul is trying to lose weight, he begins going to the gym and is working his butt off to burn some calories and get in better shape. However Saul has a sweet tooth, and loves to drink his pop and eat his candy. Saul has been going at this now for a month and has only lost two pounds. Saul gives up and never comes back.</p>
                        <h5>What did Saul do wrong?</h5>
                        <p class="page-content">He didnt compliment the workout with the Diet! Working out is like marinating your chicken before it is cooked. A marinated chicken will not taste good if it is not cooked right, and a workout will not show results if the work in the kitchen is not done right. </p>
